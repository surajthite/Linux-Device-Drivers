 # Character Driver 

This folder contains the character driver developed as a part of Advanced Embedded Software Design as a part of my Graduate Studies at CU Boulder.

I have implemented circular buffer in the character driver inorder to fetch the data from the external device at higher data rates. (I/O Decoupling). 

The unitests are written to  check the functionality of the character driver.
