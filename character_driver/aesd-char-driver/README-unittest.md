# Unit Testing
The project supports unit testing based on the [Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) framework.  To run locally on Ubuntu 18.04:

1. run `./setup-unittest.sh` to setup dependencies and generate a build sub-directory with cmake build support.
2. run `./run-unittest.sh` to run unit tests against your implementation

See the "test" directory for unit test function definitions
